Lecture notes from first half of Physics 708 - Statistical Mechanics and Stochastic Processes

During the course, I will post (partial) lecture notes to this site. The main document will be a LaTex document, but sometimes I might just post the slides from the lectures.
Start by cloning this repository, then start editing it and improving it.
When you've made some improvements to the documents or added some new content, send a pull request. This tells me that you have some new content that you think would be good to merge into the master document.

Try to regularly pull down updated versions of the document (otherwise you'll be editing something that is out of date) and to be regular with sending your pull requests to incorporate the improvements (otherwise other people won't see them and might duplicate things).
